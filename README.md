# **WildSight: Real-Time Wildlife Encyclopedia**

## **Overview**

WildSight is an innovative project focused on developing a **real-time animal recognition system** using computer vision on edge devices. Our goal is to make wildlife identification accessible and intuitive for the general public, enhancing education, conservation, and awareness in dynamic environments like safaris, zoos, and nature reserves.

## **Problem**

Current methods for wildlife identification often lack real-time capabilities, are inaccessible in remote areas, and don't provide instant, easy-to-understand species information.

## **Solution**

We've built a comprehensive computer vision pipeline that integrates:

1. **MegaDetector** for accurate animal detection and bounding box generation.  
2. **SpeciesNet** for precise species-level classification of cropped animal images.  
3. A **Flutter mobile application** for real-time display of identification results and related animal information.

This system is designed for deployment on edge devices, ensuring low-latency performance crucial for real-world applications.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Computer Vision Models:** MegaDetector, SpeciesNet  
* **Mobile Application Framework:** Flutter  
* **Datasets:** iWildCam 2020, iNaturalist 2017
